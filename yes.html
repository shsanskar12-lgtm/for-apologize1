There are some guys who genuinely need love. If I talk about myself, I'm the kind of guy who wouldn't be jealous of your laughter. I just want to be the reason behind that laughter. I don't talk much, but when you're silent, I can read your silence. I'm not a hero, and I'm not perfect either. But one thing is for sure, if I were a prince, I would make you my princess. If I were a obito, I would make you my Rain.I wanted to said that I mean is, just love me like you love tea. And if I don't get completely immersed in that love, like a biscuit in tea, then you can say whatever you want. Kha muhje denji bana tha obito ban rahu.
